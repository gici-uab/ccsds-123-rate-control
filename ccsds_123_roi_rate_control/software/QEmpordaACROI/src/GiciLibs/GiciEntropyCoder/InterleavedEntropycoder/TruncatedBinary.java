 * length, to inform exactly what amount of bits are in use in value. Moreover
 * the important nextLenghtValue() method gives the class the ability of
 * get the next value needed while making a GolombCode from certain point
 * where it must increment length in addition to value in order to make
 * next entry of the GolombCode.
