 * 
 * The purpose of this public class is to be the ancestor of the distinct kinds
 * of Component Codes which can be used, this is the GolombCode, parametrized
 * with m, his inverse tree, called GolombDecode, also dependent of m, and the
 * ShortHandCode, another prefix code not in the Golomb family and specified
 * by an String using the short hand notation. At the same time this class
 * provides other services like a quick constructor of the copy code, also
 * a posible ComponentCode and equivalent to ShortHandCode("(0,1)"). The class
 * also keeps the common data of all component codes and has some methods useful
 * for all of them, to prepare data for their constructors, check common
 * requisites, get a simple entropy from a probability and make visible some
 * methods of his descendants to the exterior of the paquet.
