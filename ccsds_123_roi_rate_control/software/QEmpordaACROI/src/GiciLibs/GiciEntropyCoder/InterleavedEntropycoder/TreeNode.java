 * The purpose of this Class is just to act like ancestor of TruncatedBinary in
 * order to act like the basic brick for binary trees to keep component coders.
 * This way the nodes made under this class can be intermediate nodes of a
 * binary tree and point to other node of TreeNode class or point to leaf
 * nodes of the binary tree, that is, a TruncatedBinary instance. The class
 * keeps two treenode references in an array to be able to make binary trees.
