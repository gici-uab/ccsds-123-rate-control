/**
 * @version 1.0
 * @author Juan Ram√≥n Soler Cabrejas
 * 
 * This class inherits from BinNodeBuffer, which provides the basic buffering
 * services CircularQueue class extends, so uses the same Node class with two
 * parts, a TreeNode reference and an int code representing the bin or container
 * in this case, with an associated code tree where the TreeNode instance
 * belongs.
 * The purpose of this class is to keep a buffer with a behavior of a circular
 * queue, this is very useful for the InterleavedEntropyEncoder instance to
 * keep in memory an amount of partial input code words and complete output
 * codewords that can not be emited to the output because they are not yet
 * complete output codewords or they are not yet at the first position of the
 * queue. This wait of every code word until be completed and at the head of the
 * queue is necesary and a central part of an InterleavedEntropyEncoder.
 * Separated bits from the input with similar probabilities to be 0 and
 * belonging to the same bin are joined to form compact output codewords, the
 * wait to be on the queue head allows the decoder to know what bit go where
 * because it can reproduce when the coder queue must be full and it generates
 * an output codeword for same container input bits.
