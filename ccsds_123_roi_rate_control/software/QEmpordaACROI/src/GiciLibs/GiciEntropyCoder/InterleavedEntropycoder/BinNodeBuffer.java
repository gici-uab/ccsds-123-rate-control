 * 
 * The purpose of this class is double, InterleavedEntropyCoder extends this
 * class and InterleavedEntropyDecoder and InterleavedEntropyCoder extends
 * the former. When this class is been inherited by de Encoder it is used to
 * store references to points in the Circular queue of output codes, when that
 * codes are partial. When this class is been inherited by the Decoder it is
 * used to store complete input codewords, but this codes need to wait there
 * until they are old enough so we can be sure about their bits are flush bits
 * or not.
