/**
 * This class is a buffered byte stream with no limits on its capacity. It implements
 * fewer functions than the Java ByteBuffer class, though it is slightly faster. It also
 * incorporates functions to temporarily save the stream in a file, so the buffer memory can
 * be freed. When the ByteStream is only needed for reading purposes, it can use the readFile
 * mode, in which the stream is linked to (segments of) a file from which bytes are read.<br>
 *
 * Usage: the object can be in three different modes: normal, readFile, and temporalFile. The
 * normal mode indicates that the stream data are in a buffer in memory. All functions to put/remove
 * bytes can be used in this mode. Also, the stream has a pointer which serves to
 * sequentially read all bytes of the stream. This pointer is only used for getting bytes, and
 * can be reset through the <code>reset</code> function.<br>
 * At any point when in the normal mode, the functions to <code>save/load from/to temporal
 * file</code> can be used to temporarily save the data in a file. When the data is in the temporal
 * file the stream is in the temporalFile mode. In this mode, the functions to get/put bytes
 * are not operative. Be aware that all objects of this class employ the same temporal file to avoid
 * the creation of many files. It is important to delete this file at the execution end by
 * calling the <code>destroyTemporalFile</code> function.<br>
 * The readFile mode can be used to link the stream to (segments of) a file from which data are read.
 * To use this mode, the object must be created with the constructor that has a FileChannel as a parameter.
 * Then, segments of the file can be added via the corresponding <code>putFileSegment</code> function.
 * At any moment, the function <code>endReadFileMode</code> can be called, loading all bytes from the
 * file to put them in memory and therefore ending the readFile mode and entering in the normal mode.
 * A stream that was a created in readFile mode can always return to that state calling the
 * function <code>returnReadFileMode</code>. Regardless of whether the data is in memory or
 * still in the file, the function <code>getByte</code>
 * reads data of the stream. When in readFile mode, the <code>get</code> functions do not advance the
 * position of the file.<br>
 * Each object of this class is intended to allocate one stream, without options to reuse the object.<br>
 *
 * Multithreading support: the object must be created and manipulated by a single thread. There
 * can be many objects of this class running simultaneously as long as a single thread manipulates each object.
